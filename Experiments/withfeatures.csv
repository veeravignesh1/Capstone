2,Must buy!,"From last 5 years my younger brother was using iphone 4s and i bought iphone 7 for his birthday gift. When i gave gift packet to him he was thinking that my bro bought watch/pen/or something else but he didn't expected iphone 7 . When he opened, i found tear in his eye and he hug me.
 
 this all possible only because of flipkart sale coz we r from middle class family and can't afford this mobile in it's actual price so flipkart makes us happy.

24,Iphone 7 and Flipkart experience,"Received Iphone 7 on the very same day when it was launched.
 Thank you Flipkart for super super fast delivery and an excellent packing of Iphone 7.
 
 Recently switched from android to IOS. So my review will be based on that.
 Pros :
 Performance: which is really amazing and that what it makes it worth for as compared to other phones apart from looks, light weight etc.
 While playing high end graphics game, the phone do get little bit heat up however as compared to android you will not observe too much of power drainage and also it cools down very quickly.
 Played two three high end graphics game alternatively/ switching alternatively and i didn`t saw any lag.
 All the games were running so smooth that i have never experienced in any of the android phones.
 
 Cons:
 Multi- tasking ease where i am currently struggling. May be just because i switched from android to IOS.",5,Certified Buyer,2016-10-01 00:00:00,127,29,READ MORE,156,0,M,155,10,0,,0,,0,0.81
25,"Sexy got black, really black!","First to Flipkart delivery service - Thanks a lot, I received it earlier than promised. I also received a chocolate from you guys, it felt really nice. Multiplied my joys of receiving my new phone.
 
 Now to the iPhone.
 
 Packaging - As always - neat & superior!
 
 The phone - It feels great. I personally chose the iPhone 7 over 7+ because of the size. Moving from iPhone 5 to 7 was absolutely no downer in terms of size, the size suited me well. Specifications wise - still exploring. ;)
 
 What's evidently different - the home button (the number 3 pressure press feels quite weird. Chose number 1 option) and yes of course the no-audio jack. So you do receive wired earphones better known as lightning compatible earphones. The end of your wired earphones connect to the slot of the lightning connector.",5,Certified Buyer,2016-10-01 00:00:00,3226,1034,READ MORE,4260,0,F,142,13,0,,0,,0,0.76

28,Awesome but don’t buy Matt black,"Pros:
 Sleek and handy, no more chunks of heavy metal
 
 Premium and stylish, Matt black looks royal.
 
 Camera is stunning, you can't believe, it nurtured a hidden photographer in me to such an extent that I bought a dslr now, most of my pics are clicked on it. Camera is comparable to point and shoot standalones.
 
 Battery life is more than sufficient.
 
 iOS is more secure and reliable.
 
 Sound is louder and crisper then 6 th generation
 
 Aluminium 7000 series is more sturdy
 
 Cons:
 
 No 3.5 mm, but there is an adapter to bridge that
 
 I my personal opinion screen should be 5 inch, reducing bezels.
 
 Price.. but I got it in deal, cheapest ever, thanks to flipkart
 
 Enjoying my iPhone . Go for it else for i8 if budget doesn't matter for u ;)
 
 
 21.11.2017-colour review
 
 I have rose gold 6s and mattblack iPhone 7, I noticed that Matt black is more prone to scratches and fading of color. Rose gold still rocks after an year.
 
 my suggestion is to buy a matellic color rather Matt.

30,Great experience,"Got this phone yesterday! I upgraded from iPhone 5c and am really happy to have made the choice. iPhone 7 does not really need an introduction or review, so let's talk about the Flipkart experience!
 
 Delivery: It got delivered within 2 days and the delivery executive also took my time frame in mind while making a delivery. Since I exchanged my old phone, he waited patiently for me to open this phone and check it before leaving. The phone was packaged really well and all the genuine documents were present inside the box! This was another great experience thanks to Flipkart and even though I was a little apprehensive about buying a phone online, this experience has made me feel a lot more confident about doing so!

 About the phone:
 Jet Black colour is awesome but the Apple Logo is not properly visible due to this colour. The back side of the phone is scratch prone so you better a back cover also at the same time. Camera is as usual awesome. Phone is handy and less weighted. Being an Android user I am finding it little bit difficult to use apple but I am learning it slowly.

Thanks again Flipkart. 😊
 
 
 Writing this after a whole YEAR of using the product, and still there is absolutely no issues with the phone. If you are looking for reassurance about the authenticity of the product before buying, then it's about genuine as they come and I really doubt if you'll get a better deal offline than the one you get during the sale which happens in Flipkart. 😊",5,Certified Buyer,2018-10-01 00:00:00,91,31,READ MORE,122,3,F,134,10,0,,0,,2,0.75

56,Good quality product,"The iPhone 7 is a very good choice for those people who want to use iPhone in budget.
 iPhone 7 is a very good product from apple.
 It have 4.7 inch display which is bigger than expected. The 3D Touch is very different from android and better than android.
 It have a quite bigger bezel both in top and bottom but the display is perfect.
 After all having very slim body, the speakers are loud and battery is 1960 mah which last a day through heavy usage.
 Talking about the performance, iPhone 7 is on top of the line.
 The A10 fusion chip is better than androids 8 chips. Talking about the Camera, Rear camera is 12MP which gives amazing picture But the Front Camera which is of 7MP gives Average photos and detail is quite moderate but cannot be consider bad.
 It’s good in Good light and bad in low light. So make sure to take a selfie in a bright day
 The IOS version 10 have nice user interface and the updates are timely updated.
 If you like Gaming like Pubg, Fortnite, Call of Duty then this phone is not for you because of 1960mah battery .

78,Amazing Little phone,"I got my phone delivered from supercomnet in 4 days from Bangalore and just loving my phone. I had a 6s and upgraded to 7 and notice considerable upgrades.

1. It has a taptic engine based soft home button so the feedback response is quick and I am happy to get off the 3.5 mm audio jack to fit in this engine.

2. Its much faster and night photography is much cleared and crisper, thanks to the 1.8f rear camera which is an upgrade from the 2.2f camera in 6s.

3. The audio driver is much better and as such the audio quality is much clearer from 6s.

4. It has dual speakers at top and bottom and the sound output is much louder and better than 6s.

5. Already a big fan of the jet black color i got.

6. The 3D touch screen is much more responsive than 6s.

Battery back up has improved over 6s by an hr and a half approx.

Over all i love this new monster and specs might undermine the power of this product but the iOS 10 is designed to give optimum and faster performance with the specs built in. So to me a 2gb ram on iPhone 7 turned out faster than the 4 gb Ram in some chinese android phones like lenovo because of optimisation.

Similarly the 12 mp 1.8f camera is much responsive than the so called 20mp moon light camera in some phones.

102,Apple countinues to outperform with its new masterpiece,"I'm using iPhone from 3GS generation. I have upgraded my iPhones every year since then. People might say its costly, but to be honest it justifies each & every single penny spent on it. It's a craftsmen masterpiece. Though it does not gives alot of features which other flagship phones do in this segment in the market, but honestly think do we really use those features in real time usage. iPhone makes your regular task so easy & simple which is their primary focus (Make user experience as simple & useful as possible). Its so fluid & fast compared to any flagship phones available in the market. Their software & hardware works seamlessly that it make the users experience alot easier & faster. Its single core scores outperforms the latest flagship of Google, samsung & one plus.

If you thinking for an upgrade from 5s/6 or 6S then its worth doing mainly for the below reasons -

1) Camera lovers would love the new 12 mp camera with ƒ/1.8 aperture on the iPhone which supports low light photography & optical image stabilization (included now in iPhone 7 too). The front facing camera is now 7 mp HD camera . It has a Quad-LED true tone flash.The pictures are so realistic & clear. The best in the market right now.
2) iPhone is now finally IP67 certified - dust and water resistant
3) Memory - Now available in 32/128/256 GB for the same price as previously for 6s 16/64/128GB respectively.
4) New A10 fusion chip is extremely fast & the graphics output is incredible like a game console.
5) Battery has been increased from 1715 mAh to 1960 mAh giving you about 2 hrs more battery life than 6s. My phone last 1 entire day with heavy usage.
6) iPhone 7 now has Quad-core processor with 2GB of RAM & iPhone 7plus with 3GB of RAM.
7) Stereo speakers are really amazing with good sound quality output.

The introduction of new colours to the iPhone rage has given one more reason to buy. My personal favourite is the matte black one (though the Jet black looks more appealing than the matte black one) , but the matte black is less prone to scratches & figure prints than the Jet Black.

I pre-ordered my iPhone 7 first time on any online site but & I must say Flipkart made it a real amazing one. The delivered me my Phone the very next day of its release in India when people where standing in line outside the store to get one.
They made it special by giving the customer a cadbury & shooting the customers expressions while unboxing their iPhones.
Thank You flipkart for this gesture. You made me feel a special customer. Looking forward to buy more electronic genuine products from you.",5,Certified Buyer,2016-10-01 00:00:00,50,25,READ MORE,75,0,M,470,27,0,,0,,0,0.67

Yes it is expensive but it is justified as Apple is known to make high quality phone. As I am both an iOS and android phone user I can say with experience that iPhone is way better built than any other of its competiton. I have an 4 years old iPhone 5 which works perfectly, same as the day I bought it. I am sure this will work equally well. And whereas I had to change the android phone thrice in 4 years I don't wanna name the brands.

 + water resistant - this is a huge improvement for me!
 +increased speed is noticeable w Siri.
 +the capacity is amazing! I can keep movies, videos, books, photos, music etc without having to store on iCloud or the like (which usually involves a monthly fee).
 + decent size (same as iPhone 6S) while remaining portable and although not as big as the 7 Plus, it can still fit in pocket.
 +Widget feature (swiping to right at home screen) has been improved and now allows editing. You can add or delete features which can be key for privacy and being able to customize is always a good thing.
 +has lots of added fun features in iMessage (not sure if its the updated software or strictly iPhone 7) like memes, automatic replies and being able to write w your fingertip.
 +camera takes much better pics (increased the megapixels and the difference is noticeable) and it has 5X zoom capability.
 +has the fingerprint option for quicker access after you enter your 6 digit pass code to begin.
 +even slimmer than the iPhone 6 but still able to stand up against something for convenient viewing.
 +speaker upgrade as it now provides stereo (not up to audiophile standards but still).
 
 BAD:
 - no headphone jack!! but box includes dongle (see photo) which inserts into charging port and provides headphone jack - I have a bet with myself on how long it will take to lose. I know wireless headphones are the future but happy with my old faithful headphones.
 -the home button is not as well defined. Its gonna take longer than 24 hrs to get used to as it takes me a few tries to activate the home button. It requires the right amount of pressure and despite offering three different options, not easy. The guys at the Apple Store need to stop showing off - on the bright side, I'm thinking it's a learning curve thing and continued use should take care of this issue.",5,Certified Buyer,2016-10-01 00:00:00,85,62,READ MORE,147,0,M,333,19,0,,0,,0,0.58

220,i (for ideal) phone,"It would be presumptuous to not acknowledge that all those who pre-ordered this device, myself included, have done it simply for the allure of the latest iPhone. Even as I say this, I wasnt entirely convinced of the iPhone 7 when I watched the livestream of the Apple Keynote. However, a timely launch in India, less exorbitant pricing and a hefty cashback was what finally swung me in favour of it.

While Apple might have not made much headway in design for 3 generations now, I take some solace in the fact that I got the Black variant which sets it apart from the earlier generations. Having said that, the accumulation of the incremental updates is what makes this a significant step up from the 6s - IP67 protection, cleaning up of antenna lines, camera with better low light performance and OIS, stereo speakers, brighter screen with wider colour gamut, 40% faster quad core CPU, hexa core GPU and the bigger 1960 mAh battery. However, the focus will be more on what has been lost, namely, the headphone jack and the physical Home button. Coming from Android phones with capacitive only buttons, the latter doesn't matter at all, especially since it is now a multi-function button that does a lot more than the physical one. However, I must admit that pressing it felt odd initially and I mistook the vibration as flexing of the case in which my phone was encased. The loss of the former however will not be an easy one. It may have been a courageous move but also a bit impractical. I use a Sony SBH54 Bluetooth headset and the audio quality is still some way off to justify using it all the time. It is even more antagonizing when you have invested a significant amount in purchasing high-end 3.5mm jack headphones. At least, there is the headphone adapter which comes only in white and goes very well (not!) with the Black variant. I guess that is a compromise I have to live with and really hope that Apple has made the Lightning port a lot sturdier. I can somehow accept this decision if indeed, as Apple has stated, it was a price to pay for a larger battery, water resistance and stereo speakers without ruining the dimensions, even though I can accept an additional 2mm of thickness any day. Apart from the device itself, you buy yourself in to a large repertoire of accessories that simply dont exist for other devices.

As far as iOS is concerned, Apple has been more forthright about picking up whats good in others (as has Android) which means a more accelerated rate of iOS progression compared to an approach of deterrence through suing. Also, Apples walled garden now has a pet door with overtures to developers to utilize aspects of iOS that were previously, preciously locked away. iOS also continues to be the platform of choice for innovative app developers who are not simply targeting income through baited ad clicks. Even Google and Microsoft continue to offer an incredible experience on iOS which is inexplicably better than what they offer on their own platform. It is perhaps not contestable that iOS offers the best security, privacy, optimization and consistency of any phone, even though most of it comes from Apples control of every aspect of the device. Also, the exclusivity of the OS has some appeal to it at a time when Android can be experienced on any PC. To sum it up, you cannot go wrong with buying the iPhone, unless you had to take out a mortgage to finance one.

P.S. I received my iPhone at around 8 p.m., about an hour after the launch and really loved the custom packaging. Enjoyed purchasing something from Flipkart after a long time.",5,Certified Buyer,2016-10-01 00:00:00,89,119,READ MORE,208,0,M,633,27,0,,0,,0,0.43

229,A Cute Little Stealthy Black Beast,"Firstly the Flipkart service is awesome. IP7 was launched on 7th Oct 7 PM and I got it by 8PM same day. A pat on their back for the excellent service. Packaging was also very very secure. A premium black box had the phone box inside it. A nice touch to the user experience all together.

About the phone. If you already have IP6S, you should not upgrade or can go for a 32gb model.
But if you have IP6 or below, upgrading to IP7 will be good decision. My brother have IP6 and when I put both these phones side by side, IP7 nails it everywhere.

IP7 - The Good.
Camera - This is undoubtedly the best camera you have on any IP and just next to Samsung S7
Display - Even if it is not quad HD or something, when you put other IPs in the side, the diff will be very obvious. A very pleasant display. A warm touch to the display feels pretty nice to look at. And also the quad HD screens have their bads.
Speakers - not Stereo but way too loud
Finger print - Now with this one, press and lift your finger as fast you can and the phone will be unlocked. We tested it on IP6, IP6S and IP7 and you can guess the winner.
Lift to Wake feature is welcoming and very useful.
Its water resistant also. I put my 70K phone in a mug of water with heavy heart (as apple does not include water damage in warranty) but nothing happened.
Finally the Black color is stealthy and awesome.
Performance - It will beat any phone by huge margins. A cute little stealthy black beast.

IP7 - The Bads.
Battery - It's not bad, I will say but it would have been a bit bigger. Best thing is if you are not using your phone, battery will not drain.
Fast Charging - This is needed in any phone today
Headphone Jack - USB Jack is pretty awesome, but the downside is that if you are low on battery and it's charging, you can't put headphones for music or calls. You have to wait for sometime. Or may be buy a bluetooth headphone.

Overall a good package and atleast for someone like me who were a loyal Android user from past 6 years, switching to Iphone (IOS) is an awesome experience. I just love everything about this phone.

For someone who's coming from iPhone 6s, this may not be a thing of excitement as it looks 90% just as same. However, what has changed is inside of the phone. With better processor, camera, water resistance technology - a lot has changed inside.

Coming to the delivery experience. I ordered this phone within one hour when the pre orders started on flipkart. I was kept well informed about the progress of my order.
I even got a personal call from flipkart executive with exact date and time slot of delivery. The delivery however was delayed by about 15 minutes but I would ignore that really.
Overall a very nice experience and I think it was a nice decision buying from flipkart as it was a total mad rush at Apple Store today.

297,"IF U DON'T HAVE AN IPHONE, WELL U DON'T AN IPHONE.","The most awaited phone of the year. Being the iPhone 5S user for over 2 years, I just love the iPhone for its sturdy built and fabulous design.

Got the phone delivered on 30/11/2016, which on time so no complaint on that.

The product was delivered safely with no damage or any such other issues.

It's an IPhone so there can't be any cons. But yes there is a lot of improvement especially the battery life. With normal usage I use it for 2 days with full charge.

The display is great, touch is fabulous, camera is the best I can say. The world is crazy for this phone. After all it's an iPhone.

346,This is 7. But doesn't live upto expectations.,"iPhone 7 - 32GB Black

Pros :
- Superfast A10 Processor
- Improved Home button (Haptic Feedback)
- Excellent Low light camera with Image stabilisation
- 32GB Storage from base models
- Improved Stereo sound from speakers
- Great battery life. Almost lasts for a day with a full charge. Significantly better than the predecessor.
- Most importantly, this time it is waterproof.

Cons :
- I had the iPhone 6S (16GB), I haven't noticed much difference and the aesthetics of the phone just feels the same. Not worth upgrading from an iPhone 6 / 6S.
- No headphone jack. Have to insert the adaptor in order to use any external headphones with 3.5mm jack.
- Screen quality is the same.

Verdict : I feel the phone was overhyped while the phone is a very good buy for new iPhone users or anyone upgrading from 5S and below.",5,Certified Buyer,2016-10-01 00:00:00,8,8,READ MORE,16,0,M,148,10,0,,0,,0,0.5

351,Best Phone I ever used,"Apple haters can say anything, well they say only 2 things, customisation and price, I am not a typical customisation guy, for me things have to work out of box as expected and it should be updated always. Data security is most important. After seeing lots of YouTube reviews I bought Samsung Galaxy S7, For one week it was cool, After that it starts to feel like another android device, Latest features only on paper no refinements, Bad UI, For any consumer device design and usability matters, well felt like it not refined just like skin over android, a lot of background services. Bad camera - in low light and back object appear below average. You can't download or update apps on roaming cellular network. I thought to exchange it with iPhone no luck on Flipkart there is not S7 option on SAMSUNG category, Outside no value for secondhand android device so I gave device brother and Bought iPhone 7. I am using a Mac as my system both work together great. As always fell grate on hands, Awesome UI, much refined apps, Better image rendering, Best security integration with apps, message grate, 1.5 days of battery backup on medium internet usage, Automatic back of all call history from old to new apple device, free apple apps as Garageband, move, 4K video shooting and more on I am loving it",5,Certified Buyer,2017-05-01 00:00:00,16,24,READ MORE,40,0,M,230,8,0,,0,,0,0.4

357,Gorgeous black,"iPhone 7 was launched at 7 PM IST on October 7 in India. I received an SMS at 7 PM that the delivery boy is out and I will be getting the product. I received my product at 8 PM, within one hour of the launch. With great excitement I open the packing that said priority. Upon opening I found a flipkart exclusive black box designed for iPhone 7. This packing is elegant and a surprise. Kudos to flipkart for the packing and delivery.

Coming to the phone:
1) The colour is elegant. Even though the design is nearly the same except for the 3.5mm earphones jack, the colour is something which makes it different and gorgeous. The touch is awesome and the phone setup is easy.
2) The speakers are louder than the previous versions of the phone. But I am not sure if it is 2 times the sound of previous phones.
3) 4G reception is good. I tried Airtel 4G and Reliance Jio.
4) The camera is good.
5) I absolutely love the customisable home button which gives me feeling that I am pressing a button which is against the feeling of using most android phones.
6) More storage is a delight.

Cons:
1) The battery backup is not great. It is draining quite fast even at minimal YouTube and internet usage with no new apps installed and running in the background.
2) The display satisfies my eyes but it could have been better when it comes to resolution. But I love what I am seeing.

364,My first proper iDevice,"Started with iOS and now back to it!

The iPhone 7 is a wondrous device with slick animations, gorgeous design, and compelling hardware - but it does come with its niggles - especially for people coming from Android. The first nick is the lack of convenient transitioning software (the move to iOS feature kept crashing on me for some reason) - so you have to start off by manually doing everything again - the same way you've been doing for the last 15 years or so. So say anything you want about technology but some things aren't changing here either. Now that we know that we have to feed all contacts manually to avoid complex data inconsistencies, you think of leaving that for last and install the super handy Trucaller app in the meantime - ONLY TO REALIZE MOMENTS LATER THAT TRUCALLER ON iOS DOES NOT SHOW A LIVE CALLER ID THE WAY IT DOES ON ANDROID - which essentially means you're left feeling completely embarrassed for the first few moments of any call you take if not the entirety of the call - AFTER which you can check the number MANUALLY and lament your lack of better judgment during a call.

But, a few more nicks later, you will most certainly come out overwhelmingly satisfied with your decision to switch to an iDevice! Long live Apple!

 No help from flipkart or seller as it is past 10 days. So much so for a 60k product. Took a Long trip to service center to find there is a software problem, the phone was restored but problem persists. They say that heating is normal and we can only do something if a overheating message comes. even if the phone feels fresh out of oven. Simply at mercy of apple now and will visit again.
 
 Just give me a replacement or my money back.

I would say after pixel it has the best camera, it has great battery life uptill now it gave around 8-9 hrs screen usage if used on low power mode though i would say go for the 7plus if your budget permits and it feels really weird after using galaxy note 4 though you would get habituated with the screen size after a while.I would also recommend get a midrange android phone as you will be using best of the both worlds.The charger that is provided is really slow only 1amp so throw that into the garbage and buy yourself an aukey quick charger though iphone will not support qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but it will charge fast from 0-80% with in 50 mins though it gets heated up which is normal.And another thing which is really annoying is to find the 3.5 mm headphone adapter whenever i need to plug in my headphnones as i dont use the stock headphones as it is really not that great.Never faced any performance issue after using for 2 months and its performance is just like new when i got.

 i got this dream phone very next day of order but it proves a nightmare for me.
 Battery goes down bu 10% if you simply work for 20 minutes.
 Return option does not work and it says visit apple support.
 Anyhow replaced the product by another piece but i must say all models have slight battery crisis.
 Phone performance is fantastic and beyond imagination .
 editing my review and adding some points after 1 yr of use;
 1.great camera,specially primary one.good low light performance.
 i think its camera is better than most of 30K chines brands.
 2.battery is ok ok type.it last for whole day for an avr user.you need to have a power bank while travelling.
 3.seamless user interface and great 3D touch
 4.fastest ever used phone

1044,Great Phone at Great Price,"Great Phone with awesome user interface
 Nothing can beat I phone
 Got at a great price where I simply exchanged my old Samsung Grand phone which if I would have sold in open market I would have received maximum 2K but Flipkart exchanged for 4K

1103,Decent phone. Recommend going for 7 plus or 8 plus,"First iPhone experience was good, courtesy Flipkart. The phone came as mentioned in the description, without any damages or tampering. I got it in exchange with my one plus one for Rs.31000 during the big billion days including emi offers etc.which was the best price one could get.
 About the product,
 Pros -
 1. Switching from android to iPhone is easy now. Except all your whatsapp backup is in google cloud and I could not find a way to get my previous chats from google to iCloud.
 2. Photos backup in my android are still in g drive, no need for them to download in iphone to take up unnecessary space.
 3. Camera is amazing with inbuilt effects.
 4. Sadly no portrait mode. Can download an app for that though.
 5. UI is amazing, obviously considering its an apple product.
 6. Multitasking and switching between apps is seamless
 Cons -
 1. Poor battery life. Lasts six hours with moderate use.
 2. No fast charging, can use 2A iPad adapter though. Charges 0 to 100 in 2 hours. Will give 40-50% charge within half hour.
 3. Small screen. 4.7 inches is small compared to 5 or 5.5 inch which provides a better experience
 4. Need a protective cover so the screen doesnt break, which changes the look. I myself bought spigen
 5. No headphone jack, if that matters to you.",5,Certified Buyer,2018-01-01 00:00:00,9,35,READ MORE,44,0,M,229,29,0,,0,,0,0.2
1209,Terrific purchase,"Pros
 1) elegant design
 2) rose gold is simply superb
 3) stereo speakers--i must say it's the loudest iPhone i ever used
 4)call quality 10/10
 5) Signal reception excellent
 6) Battery life needs to be tested. Because its only few hours since i am using it. But battery drain is too slow. So i am sure battery life will also be very good.
 7)Performance wise it's a beast. very much impressed
 8) Memory starts now at 32gb!!! Sigh of relief
 9)water proofing---dint test it
 10) Camera 9/10 --- s7 and Google pixel has better camera. Will test it soon.
 
 Cons
 1) i miss home button. because the fingerprint sensor is embedded in the display and won't get a natural feeling of using home button
 2) lack of audio jack.
 
 Lastly i want to thank flipkart for delivering the phone on 7th October 2016. Thanks a lot. Overall very happy with iPhone 7.",5,Certified Buyer,2016-10-01 00:00:00,3,14,READ MORE,17,0,M,152,13,0,,0,,0,0.18

1231,Highly recommended,"This phone is a beast.The phone is super awesome. Very sleek and photo clarity is superb. Headset also rocks. Battery lasts nearly one and half days. Have been using android for quite some years and i can definitely say how stable the ios is, including the apps. The touch sensor and taptic engine is tremendously fast and responsive. Camera has stunned me, i have been using nexus and one plus so far, though i will definitely not say it is better than those phones in terms of quality.

1260,Apple Nails It Again!,"No matter what the people say, iPhone 7 is the best phone you can buy in the market. The 4.7 inch display is beautiful and beats most of the 1080p displays in the market. The battery life has been amazing even though it has been just under 24 hours of use. The major improvement is in the camera. It has been improved significantly and can capture some stunning photos. The absence of a headphone jack doesn't bother me because I am use to using bluetooth headphones and when I need to i can use the included lighting ear pods. If your planning to buy this phone then its a no brainer. The phone is fantastic and the experience is one of a kind.
 The delivery from Flipkart was just outstanding. The launch was at 7 pm and i received the product at 8:25 pm, well what more can I ask for.",5,Certified Buyer,2016-10-01 00:00:00,1,9,READ MORE,10,0,M,151,10,0,,0,,0,0.1

Having been a 4S 16GB user for the past 4 years, the hardware upgrade towards screen, raw speed and storage was much needed.

1230,iPhone 7 review,"The IPhone 7 is a great device. There are no lags whatsoever. The feel of the phone is so premium. IOS users will love IOS 10.
 The camera quality is excellent however the galaxy s7 camera is my favourite. The price is a bit too high but it's still a pretty good device. All apple devices will last a few years, so it's better than buying a new android phone every year. Overall I recommend the IPhone 7 however the galaxy s7 edge is just as good but 10k cheaper.",5,Certified Buyer,2016-10-01 00:00:00,2,8,,10,0,M,90,8,0,,0,,0,0.2
